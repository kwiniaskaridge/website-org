- Enforce by legal means the provisions of the Declaration, these Bylaws and the Rules and Regulations and act on behalf of the Lot Owners with respect to all matters as provided for in the Declaration, the Act, these Bylaws, and applicable law.  The Executive Board may determine whether to take enforcement action by exercising the Association's power to impose sanctions or commencing an action for a violation of the Declaration, Bylaws, and rules, including whether to compromise any claim for unpaid Assessments or other claim made by or against it.  The Executive Board does not have a duty to take enforcement action if it determines that, under the facts and circumstances presented:
  - the Association's legal position does not justify taking any or further enforcement action;
  - the covenant, restriction, or rule being enforced is or is likely to be construed as inconsistent with law;
  - although a violation may exist or may have occurred, it is not so material as to be objectionable to a reasonable person or to justify expending the Association's resources; or
  - it is not in the Association's best interests to pursue an enforcement action.
  The Executive Board's decision under this subsection not to pursue enforcement under one set of circumstances does not prevent the Executive Board from taking enforcement action under another set of circumstances, but the Executive Board may not be arbitrary or capricious in taking enforcement action.
- Obtain and carry fidelity insurance and insurance againsts casualties and liabilities, as provided in the Declaration, the Act and in these Bylaws, pay the premiums therefor and adjust and settle any claim thereunder.

All books and records shall be kept in accordance with good accounting practices.
- Borrow money on behalf of the Association when required in connection with any one instance relating to the operation, care, upkeep and maintenance of the Association; provided, however, that the consent of at least two-thirds of the votes of Lot Owners, obtained at a meeting duly called and held for such purpose in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws, shall be required to borrow any sum which would cause the total debt of the Association to exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00).
- Acquire, hold and dispose of Lots and mortgage the same if such expenditures and hypothecations are included in the budget adopted by the Association.
- Do such other things and acts permitted by and not inconsistent with the Act, the Declaration or these Bylaws which the Executive Board may be authorized to do by a resolution of the Association, and exercise all other powers that may be exercised in this state by organizations of the same type as the Association.

  - suspend a Lot Owner's right to vote;

- The budget shall be ratified by the Lot Owners in accordance with the terms of the Declaration and the Act, as follows:  Not later than thirty (30) days after adoption of a proposed budget, the Executive Board shall provide to all the Lot Owners a summary of the budget, including any reserves, and a statement of the basis on which any reserves are calculated and funded.  Simultaneously, the Executive Board shall set a date not less than ten (10) days or more than sixty (60) days after providing the summary for a meeting of the Lot Owners to consider ratification of the budget.  Unless at that meeting a majority of all Lot Owners or any larger number specified in the Declaration reject the budget, the budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is present.  If a proposed budget is rejected, the budget last ratified by the Lot Owners continues until Lot Owners ratify a subsequent budget.
#### Assessment of Common Expenses
The total amount of the estimated funds required from Assessments for the operation of the Planned Community set forth in the budget adopted by the Executive Board shall be assessed against each Lot Owner in proportion to the respective Allocated Interest of each Lot.  The Assessment against each Lot shall begin on the date specified in the Declaration.
#### Excess Funds
Any funds collected during any fiscal year in excess of actual expenditures for that fiscal year shall be either applied to succeeding years' expenses or refunded, pro rata, to the Lot Owners.
#### Reserves
The Executive Board shall include in the budget and build up and maintain reasonable reserves for working capital, operations, contingencies and replacements as necessary to meet secondary mortgage market requirements.  The proportionate interest of any Lot Owner in any replacement reserve shall be appurtenant to the Lot and shall not be separately withdrawn, assigned or transferred.  If the reserve is inadequate for any reason, the Board may levy a further Assessment, payable as the Board determines necessary at any time.  The Board will specifically earmark such capital reserve fund for stated capital purposes and keep special assessments in a separate bank account.  The Board shall keep documentation of and treat all such funds as capital items on the Association books.
#### Working Capital Funds
The Board shall establish a working capital fund which shall be used for the start-up costs of the Association, including the purchase of cleaning and maintenance equipment, furniture and fixtures beyond that supplied by the Declarant and any initial insurance fees.  Additionally, start-up costs shall include extraordinary expenditures, temporary operating deficits due to seasonal fluctuations, etc.
#### Effect of Failure to Prepare or Adopt Budget
The failure or delay of the Executive Board to prepare or adopt a budget for any fiscal year shall not constitute a waiver or release in any manner of a Lot Owner's obligation to pay his or her allocable share of the Common Expenses as herein provided whenever the same shall be determined and, in the absence of any annual budget or adjusted budget, each Lot Owner shall continue to pay each monthly installment at the monthly rate established for the previous fiscal year until notice of the monthly payment which is due.
#### Availability of Financial Statements and Project Documents
Upon the receipt of a written request by the Association from a Lot Owner or an Institutional Mortgagee, the Association shall make the most recent regularly prepared income and expense statement of the Association, the current operating budget of the Association and all project related documents, including the Declaration, Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, books and records of the Association available for inspection during regular business hours at the Association's office.
#### Special Assessments
The Executive Board, at any time, may propose a special assessment.  Except as otherwise provided below, the assessment is effective only if the Executive Board follows the procedures for ratification of a budget described in Section 5.1(b) and the Lot Owners do not reject the proposed assessment.  If the Executive Board determines by a two-thirds vote that a special assessment is necessary to respond to an emergency:
- the special assessment becomes effective immediately in accordance with the terms of the vote;
- notice of the emergency assessment must be provided promptly to all Lot Owners; and
- the Executive Board may spend the funds paid on account of the emergency assessment only for the purposes described in the vote.
### Section 5.2 - Payment of Common Expenses
No Lot Owner may exempt himself/herself from liability for his/her contribution toward Common Expenses by waiver of the use of enjoyment of any of the Common Elements or by abandonment of his or her Lot.  All accounts not paid when due, including interest and costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be a lien against the Lot Owner's Lot.  Prior to or at the time of any conveyance of a Lot by a Lot Owner, all iens and unpaid Assessments shall be paid in full and discharged.
### Section 5.3 - Collection of Assessments
The Executive Board, or the Managing Agent at the request of the Executive Board, shall take prompt action to collect any Assessments for Common Expenses due from any Lot Owner which remain unpaid for more than thirty (30) days from the due date for payment thereof.  Any assessment, or installment thereof, not paid within five (5) days after the due date shall accrue a late charge in such reasonable amount as a percentage of the overdue assessment or installment as the Executive Board shall establish from time to time.  Any Lot Owner who fails to make such payment within such period shall also be assessed the costs incurred by the Association to collect such unpaid assessments.  All such assessments for Common Expenses, including interest, penalties, attorneys' fees, and costs shall become on the date such assessments are due, a lien against the Lot so assessed, and shall also be the personal obligation of the Lot Owner at the time the Assessments become due.
### Section 5.4 - Statements
#### Statement of Common Expenses
Within ten (10) days after a request by a Lot Owner, the Executive Board shall provide the Lot Owner with a written statement of all unpaid Assessments for Common Expenses due from the Lot Owner.  The Executive Board may impose a reasonable charge for the preparation of such statement.
#### Statement of Default
The Executive Board will make a reasonable effort to notify any mortgagee of any Lot, upon request, of any default in the performance by the Lot Owner of any obligation pursuant to the Declaration, the Bylaws and the Rules and Regulations, which is not cured within sixty (60) days of notice to each Lot Owner of such default.
### Section 5.5 - Actions to Foreclose a Lien
- The Association may not commence an action to foreclose a lien on a Lot unless:
  - the Low Owner, at the time the action is commenced, owes a sum equal to at least three months of Common  Expense assessments based on the periodic budget last adopted by the Association pursuant to Section 5.1 (in accordance with Section 3-115(a) of the Act) and the Lot Owner has failed to accept or comply with a payment plan offered by the Association; and
  - the Executive Board votes to commence a foreclosure action specifically against that Lot.
- Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Association shall apply any sums paid by Lot Owners that are delinquent in paying assessments in the following order:
  - unpaid assessments;
  - late charges;
  - reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and other reasonable collection charges; and
  - all other unpaid fees, charges, fines, penalties, interest, and late charges.
- Notwithstanding Section (a) of this Section 5.5, unless sums due the Association include an unpaid assessment, a foreclosure action may not be commenced against the Lot unless the Association has a judgment against the Lot Owner for the sums due the Association and has perfected a judgment lien against the Lot.
- Every aspect of a foreclosure, sale, or other disposition under this Section, including the method, advertising, time, date, place, and terms, must be commercially reasonable.

  - restrict the leasing of residential Lots to the extent those rules are reasonable designed to meet underwriting requirements of institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by first mortgages on Lots in Planned Community or regularly purchase those mortgages; provided, however, that any rule restricting leasing shall contain reasonable provisions to protect or grandfather any leasing permitted before the adoption of the rule.
- The Association's internal business operating procedures need not be adopted as rules.
